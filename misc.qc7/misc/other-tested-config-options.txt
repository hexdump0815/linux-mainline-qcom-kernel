the below options are options i tested to add to misc.qc7/options/additional-options-special.cfg
in order to try to get a kernel config for the sc7180 woa systems which is based on defconfig,
but in the end i still ended up with rcu stalls and a still not properly booting kernel - the
changes which made it work in the end are the ones coming in the above mentioned file with this
same commit as this file

# some more options taken over from the travmurav sc7180_defconfig resulting .config
# looks like they were not really required to avoid rcu stalls at boot
