this is a work in progress version of the galaxy book go dts - it is not useable in this state!

some ideas of it:
- start with the acer aspire 1 dts from travmurav which is know to work for that device and thus should be a good starting point
- adjust some things like keyboard and touchpad which are partially working on the galaxy book go to those values
- comment out some less important stuff like audio and bluetooth to look at this later
- try to adjust things like i2c and gpios to the galacy book go hardware based on the galaxy dsl and by comparing the acer to the galaxy dsl
- add a lot of comments about why some things are done the way they are done
- add TODO label for everything still unclear
